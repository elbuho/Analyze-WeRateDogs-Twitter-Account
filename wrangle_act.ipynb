That amount of NAN (None) is huge and at the same times there are value like a, an, the, which are not names, all of them start with lowercase, 109 names that star with lowercase where none of them are dog names. They extracted the names of the dog from the column text after the phrases \"this is\" or \"here is\", but some names , appear right after 'named'.\n",
    "* Issue #4.- In expanded_urls, there are some repeated url in the same field or doesn't star with https://twitter.com/. We are going to clean this column extracting the correct patron like https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/889531135344209921/photo/1 or video.\n",
    "* Issue #5.- We find values in the rating_numerator less than 10 and some values so high like 1776, 960 or 666. The rating-denominator had some values in the denominator different than 10. We found that in the column text there is a patron where the rating is at the end of the tweet and also there are some values in the numerator in the text column with decimal places that is causing problems as well as we found in the same tweet more the one rating patron. It seem that they extracted the rating from the first one.\n",
